9. In  **Notepad**, type:  **_&lt;your name&gt;_**. You will notice that the default font is used and not the font that you selected on  **LON-CL1**. Close Notepad, and do not save changes.

>  **Note:** UE-V uses the local settings cache by default. This is the reason why changes from **LON-CL1** are not used on **LON-CL2** yet.

10. In Windows PowerShell, type:  **Set-UevConfiguration–SyncMethod None** to configure UE-V to read settings directly from the network instead from the local settings cache, and then press Enter.

11. In Windows PowerShell, type:  **notepad**, and then press Enter.

12. In Notepad, type:  **_&lt;your name&gt;_**. You will notice that the large Verdana font that you selected on  **LON-CL1** is being used. UE-V on **LON-CL2** is now reading settings from the network location.

13. In Notepad, select  **Format**, select  **Font**, select  **Arial** font, select Size **26**, select  **OK**, and then close Notepad without saving changes.

14. On  **LON-CL1**, in Windows PowerShell, type:  **Set-UevConfiguration–SyncMethodNone**, and then press Enter.

15. In Windows PowerShell, type:  **notepad**, and then press Enter.

16. In Notepad, verify that  **Arial** font size **26** is used, as you selected on **LON-CL2**. This is because you configured UE-V on  **LON-CL1** to read the settings directly from the network.

17. Close Notepad, and do not save changes.

>  **Note:** You would typically configure **SyncMethod** by using Group Policy. In this lab, you configured it manually to see the difference between UE-V using local settings cache and reading settings directly from the shared network folder.
