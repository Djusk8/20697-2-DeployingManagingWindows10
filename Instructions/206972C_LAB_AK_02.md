>  **Note:** In the answer file, you specified that the volume should have a size of 99,000 megabytes (MB). 1 gigabyte (GB) is 1,024 MB, and therefore, 96.6 GB is approximately 99,000 MB.


7. On the taskbar, right-click  **Start**, and then select  **Computer Management**.

8. In  **Computer Management**, in the navigation pane, expand  **Local Users and Groups**, select  **Users**, and then in the details pane, verify that the user named  **Admin** has the description **My local Admin**, as you configured in the answer file.


>  **Note:** You can install custom apps, such as Microsoft Office, and customize the reference computer before running the System Preparation Tool (Sysprep) and capturing the image. We will skip the customization part in this lab.


9. On the taskbar, right-click  **Start**, select  **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**, and then select  **Yes** in the **User Account Control** dialog box.

10. In the  **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```

11. In the  **System Preparation Tool 3.14** dialog box, select the **Generalize** check box, in the **Shutdown** drop-down list, select **Shutdown**, and then select  **OK**.

12. After  **LON-CL5** turns off, select **Action**, select  **Checkpoint**, type  **Generalized** in the text box, and then select **Yes**. 



#### Task 2: Capture the reference computer image
  
1. In the  **Hyper-V Manager** console, right- click **20697-2C-LON-CL5**, and then select  **Settings**.

2. In the  **Settings for20697-2C-LON-CL5** window, in the navigation pane, select **DVD Drive**.

4. In the  **20697-2C-LON-CL5** window, on the toolbar, select the **Start** button. When **LON-CL5** starts, press any key to start the computer from the DVD media.

5. In the  **Administrator: X:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe** window, type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Net use g: \\lon-cl1\Images Pa55w.rd /user:adatum\administrator
  ```

6. Type the following command, and then press Enter to capture the image of the reference computer:


```
dism /Capture-Image /ImageFile:g:\Reference.wim /CaptureDir:c:\ /name:"Reference Image"
```

>  **Note:** You can continue with the lab while the capture is in progress.


#### Task 3: View information about the default Windows 10 image
  
1. On the host computer, in the  **Hyper-V Manager** console, right-click **20697-2C-LON-CL1**, and then select  **Settings**.

2. In the  **Settings for20697-2C-LON-CL1** window, in the navigation pane, select **DVD Drive**.

3. In the details pane, select the  **Image file** button, browse to **D:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Learning\\20697-2\\Drives**, double-click  **Win10_1709_Eval.iso**, and then select  **OK**.

4. On  **LON-CL1**, in File Explorer, in the navigation pane, select  **DVD Drive (D:)**. In the details pane, double-click  **sources**, right-click  **install.wim**, and then select  **Properties**. View the properties of the Windows image file, and then select  **OK**.


>  **Note:** Note that the file size is 3.45 GB (3,709,075,311 bytes) and that there is another Windows image file named **Boot.wim** in the folder.


5. On the taskbar, right-click  **Start**, and then select  **Windows PowerShell**.

6. In the Windows PowerShell command-line interface, type the following command, and then press Enter to view the contents of the  **install.wim** file:

  ```
  dism /Get-ImageInfo /ImageFile:d:\sources\install.wim
  ```

7. Verify that the Windows image file has one image named  **Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation** and that image has a size of more than 15 GB. This illustrates how the Windows image file format effectively compresses files.

8. You can view additional details about the image by using the image index. For example, you can get more extensive information about the Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation image by typing the following command, and then pressing Enter:


```
dism /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:d:\sources\install.wim /index:1
```



#### Task 4: Capture the custom image
  
1. On  **LON-CL1**, in the  **Windows PowerShell** window, create a Windows image file that contains the contents of the **C:\\Windows\\INF** folder by typing the following cmdlet, and then pressing Enter:

  ```
  New-WindowsImage -ImagePath C:\Image.wim -CapturePath C:\Windows\INF -Name "First image"
  ```

2. On the taskbar, select  **File Explorer**. In the navigation pane, expand  **Local Disk (C:)**, and then select  **Windows**. In the details pane, right-click the  **INF** folder, and then select **Properties**. Note the folder size, and then select  **OK**.

3. In the  **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press Enter to view the size of the Windows image file:

  ```
  dir c:\image.wim 
  ```

>  **Note:** Although the size of the **INF** folder is almost 40 MB, you will see that **image.wim** is less than 5 MB. This illustrates how effectively the initial files were compressed when they were added to the Windows image file.


4. To capture the same content to a second image in the same Windows image file, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter: 

  ```
  Add-WindowsImage -ImagePath C:\Image.wim -CapturePath C:\Windows\INF -Name "Second image"
  ```

>  **Note:** Note that the second image, which has the same content as the first image, is adds much faster.


5. Review the size of the Windows image file that now contains two images by typing the following command, and then pressing Enter:

  ```
  dir c:\image.wim 
  ```

>  **Note:** Note that **image.wim** is only slightly larger. The Windows image file format uses a single instance store, so each file is stored only once. Because the files in both images are the same, each file is contained only once.


6. Type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter to verify which images are in the  **image.wim** file:


```
Get-WindowsImage -ImagePath C:\Image.wim
```



#### Task 5: Service and update the image
  
1. On  **LON-CL1**, in File Explorer, view the size of the  **C:\\image.wim** file, and then note when the file was last modified.

2. In the  **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following two commands, and then press Enter after each command. The first command creates the folder, and the second command mounts the second image in the **image.wim** Windows image file to the created folder:

  ```
  mkdir c:\mount
dism /Mount-wim /WimFile:c:\image.wim /Index:2 /MountDir:c:\mount
  ```

3. In File Explorer, view the properties of the  **C:\\mount** folder. Note that the size and contents of the folder are exactly the same as the contents of the **C:\\Windows\\INF** folder.

4. In File Explorer, browse to the  **C:\\mount** folder, and then create a subfolder named **Folder1**. Select and delete the  **1394.PNF**,  **acpi.PNF**, and  **acpidev.PNF** files, and then close File Explorer.

5. In the  **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press Enter to unmount the image:

  ```
  dism /Unmount-Wim /MountDir:c:\mount /Commit
  ```

6. Type the following command, and then press Enter to view the size of the Windows image file:

  ```
  dir c:\image.wim
  ```

7. In Windows PowerShell, type the following command, and then press Enter to view the content of the Windows image file:

  ```
  dism /Get-ImageInfo /ImageFile:c:\image.wim
  ```

8. In the  **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following two commands, and then press Enter after each command. Commands show metadata information about both the images in the Windows image file:


```
dism /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:c:\image.wim /index:1
dism /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:c:\image.wim /index:2
```

>  **Note:** Note that the second image has one more folder and three fewer files than the first image. Remember that you created one folder and deleted three files in this task.


#### Task 6: Prepare for the next module
  
 When you have finished the lab, revert all virtual machines back to their initial state:

1. On the host computer, start Hyper-V Manager.

2. In the  **Virtual Machines** list, right-click **20697-2C-LON-DC1**, and then click  **Revert**.

3. In the  **Revert Virtual Machines** dialog box, click **Revert**.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for  **20697-2C-LON-CL1,20697-2C-LON-CL3, 20697-2C-LON-CL4,** and **20697-2C-LON-CL5.**


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully generalized and captured an image of the reference computer. You should have also performed offline servicing of the image.
