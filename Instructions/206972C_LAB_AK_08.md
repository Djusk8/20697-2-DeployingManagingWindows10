## Exercise 1: Signing up and managing Microsoft Store for Business
  
#### Task 1: Sign up for Microsoft Store for Business and perform initial configuration
  
1. On  **LON-CL2**, select  **Microsoft Edge** on the taskbar.

2. In Microsoft Edge, type  [**https://www.microsoft.com/business-store**](https://www.microsoft.com/business-store) in the address bar, and then press Enter.

3. In the top-right corner of Microsoft Edge, select the  **Sign in** link.

    >  **Note:** The page localizes based on your location.

4. In the  **Sign in to Microsoft Store** dialog box, in the **someone@example.com** text box, type **GAdmin@*&lt;YourInitials&gt;&lt;MMDDYY&gt;*outlook.onmicrosoft.com**, select  **Next**, in the  **Password** text box, type the password that you have configured for this user in module 3, and then select **Sign in**.

    >  **Note:** If you followed the suggestion in Module 3, “Managing Windows 10 sign-in and identity,” you created a Microsoft account in the **_&lt;YourInitials&gt;&lt;MMDDYY&gt;_@outlook.com** format. For example, if your name is Don Funk and you created a Microsoft account on December 18, 2017, your account should be DF121817@outlook.com. In this case, you should sign in as  **GAdmin@DF121817outlook.onmicrosoft.com**.

5. On the  **Microsoft Store for Business** page, select **Manage**.

6. On the  **Microsoft Store for Business and your data** dialog box, select the checkbox, and then click **Accept**.

    >  **Note:** When you sign up for Microsoft Store for Business, the portal automatically adds Microsoft Sway, Microsoft OneNote, Microsoft PowerPoint Mobile, Microsoft Excel Mobile, and Microsoft Word Mobile to your private store. It might take up to 36 hours for the apps to appear in the private store. These apps are automatically available for you to deploy to users.

8. In the navigation pane, select  **Settings**. In the details pane, on the  **Shop** tab, in the **Shopping experience** section, turn the **Show offline apps** switch to **On**.

11. Verify that the second option from the left on the toolbar below  **Microsoft Store for Business** is now **Adatum Store**. This is your private store.

12. In the  **Settings** details pane, select the **Devices** tab (Don’t confuse this option with the **Devices** option in the navigation pane!), and then review where you can configure Device Guard signer policies. 

   >  **Note:** When configured, these policies allow apps from Microsoft Store for Business to run on a device that Windows Defender Device Guard is protecting.
