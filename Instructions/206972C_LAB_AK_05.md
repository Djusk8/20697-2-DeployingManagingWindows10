1. On  **LON-CL1**, in the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, expand  **Technicians** OU, right-click **Background2**, and then select  **Link Enabled**, which disables the GPO link.

2. In the details pane, verify that  **Background2** GPO is no longer shown and **Background1** GPO has now the highest precedence.

3. In the navigation pane, right-click  **Technicians** OU, and then select **Block Inheritance**. This blocks GPO inheritance on  **Technicians** OU.

4. In the navigation pane, verify that a blue exclamation mark is added to Technicians OU because you set block inheritance. In the details pane, verify that no GPO is listed on Group Policy Inheritance tab.

5. On  **LON-CL2**, on the taskbar, right-click  **Start**, select  **Shut down or sign out**, select  **Sign out** and then sign in as **Adatum\\Beth** and use **Pa55w.rd** as her password.

6. Verify that Beth’s background changed to black, as neither Background1 nor Background2 GPOs are applying to her.

7. On  **LON-CL1**, in the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, right-click  **Background2** GPO, and then select **Link Enabled** to enable GPO’s link.

8. In the details pane, verify that Background2 is the only GPO that is listed on the Group Policy Inheritance tab.

9. In the navigation pane, right-click  **Background1** GPO, and then select **Enforced**.

10. In the navigation pane, verify that lock icon is added to Background1 because you enforced the GPO link. Right-click  **Technicians** OU, and then select **Refresh**.

11. In the details pane, on the Group Policy Inheritance tab, verify that Background1 GPO has precedence of 1, even if it is linked to higher OU than Background2. This is because Background1 GPO link is enforced.

12. On  **LON-CL2**, on the taskbar, right-click  **Start**, select  **Shut down or sign out**, select  **Sign out** and then sign in as **Adatum\\Beth** and use **Pa55w.rd** as her password.

13. Verify that after a few seconds, Beth’s background changes to the image of a person running, which is configured in  **Background1 GPO**.



#### Task 4: Working with RSoP reports
  
1. On  **LON-CL1**, in the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, right-click  **Group Policy Results**, and then select  **Group Policy Results Wizard**.

2. In the  **Group Policy Results Wizard**, select  **Next**, select the  **Another computer** check box, type **LON-CL2** in the text box, and then select **Next**.

3. On the  **User Selection** page, verify that you can select only among users that have already signed in to **LON-CL2**. For example, user  **Adatum\\Tia** is not listed and you cannot select her, although this user exists in the Adatum domain. Verify that **ADATUM\\Beth** is selected, select **Next** twice, and then select **Finish**.

4. In the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, verify that the **Beth on lon-cl2** node is added under Group Policy Results. In the details pane, select **Details** tab.

5. In the details pane, select  **show all**. Scroll down to the  **User Details** section, which is toward the end of the report. In that section, find information that **Background1** is the winning GPO, and that it sets **Screen Saver Timeout** to **1860** seconds.

6. In the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, right-click  **Beth on lon-cl2**, and then select  **Advanced View**. The  **Resultant Set of Policy** snap-in opens.

7. In  **Resultant Set of Policy**, expand  **Administrative Templates** in **User Configuration**, expand  **Desktop,** and then select **Desktop** below.

>  **Note:** Notice that only the **Control Panel** and **Desktop** nodes appear under **Administrative Templates**. This is because you configure GPO settings only in those two nodes.

8. In the details pane, double-click  **Desktop Wallpaper**. Verify that on Settings tab you can view setting that was applied. Select  **Precedence** tab, verify that it lists all GPOs that have this settings configured, select **Cancel**, close Resultant Set of Policy, and then select  **No**.

9. In the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, right-click  **Group Policy Modeling**, and then select  **Group Policy Modeling Wizard**.

10. In the  **Group Policy Modeling Wizard**, select  **Next** twice.

11. On  **User and Computer Selection** page, select the **User** check box, in the **User information** section, select **Browse**, type  **tia**, and then select  **OK**. In the  **Computer information** section, select **Browse**, expand  **Adatum**, select  **Computers**, select  **OK** and then select **Next**.

12. In the  **Group Policy Modeling Wizard**, review the settings that you can configure on each page, select  **Next** seven times, and then select **Finish**.

>  **Note:** In the **Group Policy Modeling Wizard**, you can configure many additional settings, which you cannot set when you run the  **Group Policy Results Wizard**. The  **Group Policy Results Wizard** shows what happened in the past and you cannot influence that, whereas the **Group Policy Modeling Wizard** shows what will happen under some assumptions and you can specify those assumptions.

13. In the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, verify that the  **Tia on Computers** node is added under **Group Policy Modeling**. In the details pane, select the  **Details** tab.

14. In the details pane, select  **show all**. Scroll down to the  **User Details** section, which is toward the end of the report.  
Verify that no user setting would apply, because Tia’s account is in the **Research** OU and neither **Background1** nor **Background2** GPOs apply to that OU.



#### Task 5: Creating a central store
  
1. On  **LON-CL1**, in the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, right-click  **Background1** GPO and then select **Edit**.

2. In Group Policy Management Editor, in the navigation pane, expand  **Policies** under Computer Configuration, verify that the Administrative Template nodes state that **policy definitions are retrieved from the local computer** and then close Group Policy Management Editor.

3. On the taskbar, select  **File Explorer**.

4. In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, expand  **This PC**, expand  **Local Disk (C:)**, and then select  **Windows**. In the details pane, right-click  **PolicyDefinitions** folder, and then select **Copy**.

12. In the details pane, right-click  **UserExperienceVirutalization.admx** file, select **Delete**, and then select  **Yes**.

13. On  **LON-CL1**, in the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, right-click  **Background1** GPO and then select **Edit**.

14. In Group Policy Management Editor, in the navigation pane, expand  **Policies** under **Computer Configuration**, expand  **Administrative Templates** and verify that the **Microsoft Office 2016 (Machine)** node is now present.

15. In the navigation pane, expand  **Windows Components**, verify that the **Microsoft User Experience Virtualization** node is not present and then close Group Policy Management Editor.

16. On  **LON-DC1**, on the taskbar, select  **Server Manager**.

17. In  **Server Manager**, select  **Tools** menu and then select **Group Policy Management**.

18. In the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, expand  **Forest: Adatum.com**, expand  **Domains**, expand  **Adatum.com** and expand **IT** OU. Right-click **Background1** GPO and then select **Edit**.

19. In Group Policy Management Editor, in the navigation pane, expand  **Policies** under **Computer Configuration** and verify that the **Administrative Template** nodes depict that policy definitions were **retrieved from the central store**.

20. In the navigation pane, expand  **Administrative Templates** and verify that the:  
**Microsoft Office 2016 (Machine)** node *is* present, because all domain computers use administrative templates from the central store.

21. In the navigation pane, expand  **Windows Components**, verify that the:  
**Microsoft User Experience Virtualization** node *is not* present because you deleted the administrative template for UE-V and then close the Group Policy Management Editor and **GPMC**.

**Microsoft Office 2016 (Machine)** node *is not* present. Expand **Windows Components**, verify that the **Microsoft User Experience Virtualization** node *is* present and then close Group Policy Management Editor.

    >  **Note:** Updates that you performed in central store are not effective, because local copy of administrative templates is used again.

<!-- -->

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured and linked GPOs, modified the GPO processing order, created a central store, and generated an RSoP report.


## Exercise 2: Configuring and using Group Policy preferences
  
#### Task 1: Configuring Group Policy preferences
  
1. On  **LON-CL1**, in the  **GPMC**, in the navigation pane, right-click  **Technicians** OU, select **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here**, in Name text box type  **Preferences** and then select **OK**.

8. In Windows PowerShell, type  **gpupdate /force**, and then press Enter to refresh the GPOs.

>  **Note:** This time Shortcut1 does not reappear. Although Beth was listed in the **Security Filtering** section, GPOs are applied in the computers’ security context. Because **LON-CL2**, the computer on which Beth is signed in, does not have at least Read permissions to the  **Preferences** GPO, it cannot apply the settings from the GPO.

9. On  **LON-CL1**, in the details pane, in  **Security Filtering** section, select **Add**, type  **domain computers**, and then select  **OK**.

10. On  **LON-CL2**, in Windows PowerShell, type  **gpupdate /force**, and then press Enter to refresh the GPOs. This time  **Shortcut1** reappears, because **LON-CL2** is a member of the **Domain Computers** group and it has permission to read the **Preferences** GPO.

>  **Note:** Filter condition should read: free disk space is greater than or equal to **90 GB** on the system drive **AND** the folder **C:\\Folder1** exists.

17. In Targeting Editor, select  **OK**, in the  **Shortcut1 Properties** dialog box, select **OK** and then close Group Policy Management Editor.

18. On  **LON-CL2**, in Windows PowerShell, type the following command to create large file, and then press Enter (the number 6 is followed by 10 zeroes): 

  ```
  Fsutil file createnew file1.txt 60000000000
  ```

19. On the taskbar, select  **File Explorer**.

20. In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click  **Local Disk (C:)**, select  **Properties**, view Free space, and then select  **OK**. Disk C: has less than 90 GB free space.

21. On the desktop, right-click  **Shortcut1**, and then select  **Delete**.

22. In Windows PowerShell, type  **gpupdate /force**, and then press Enter to refresh the GPOs.

>  **Note:** **Shortcut1** *does not* appear, as the disk has *less than* **90GB** free space and the folder **C:\\Folder1** *does not* exist.

23. In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, select  **Local Disk (C:)**. In the details pane, right-click empty space, select  **New**, select  **Folder**, type  **Folder1**, and then press Enter. 

24. In Windows PowerShell, type  **gpupdate /force**, and then press Enter to refresh the GPOs.

>  **Note:** **Shortcut1** *does not* appear. Although **C:\\Folder1** now *exists*, the disk still has *less than* **90GB** free space.

25. In Windows PowerShell, type  **del file1.txt**, and then press Enter.

26. In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, right-click  **Local Disk (C:)**, select  **Properties**, view Free space, and then select  **OK**. Disk C: now has *more than* **90 GB** free space.

27. In Windows PowerShell, type  **gpupdate /force**, and then press Enter to refresh the GPOs.

>  **Note:** *Both* conditions from item-level targeting *are met* and **Shortcut1** now appears on the desktop.


#### Task 3: Prepare for the next module
  
 When you are finished with the lab, revert  **LON-CL1** and **LON-CL2** virtual machines to their initial state:

1. On  **LON-DC1**, where you are signed in as Adatum\\Administrator, on the taskbar, select  **File Explorer**.
