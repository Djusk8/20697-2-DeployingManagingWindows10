# Module 10: Managing data access for Windows-based devices
# Lab A: Implementing and using Work Folders
  
### Scenario
  
 Users at Adatum Corporation access company data by using company-owned computers that are joined to the domain. Many users bring their own devices to work and would like to access company data by using them. Users with their own tablets complain that when they copy data locally, it is difficult to maintain synchronization with files on the company’s file servers. IT administrators complain that they do not have an overview of devices that users use for accessing company data and that they cannot enforce company security policies on data that is stored locally on such devices. You have decided to implement the Work Folders feature to address these issues.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you will be able to configure Work Folders.

### Lab setup
  
 Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Virtual machines: 

-  **20697-2C-LON-DC1**

-  **20697-2C-LON-CL2**

-  **20697-2C-LON-CL4**

-  **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**

 User name:  **Adatum\\Administrator**,  **Adatum\\Adam**, and  **Admin**.

 Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

 For this lab, you will use the available virtual machine environment. Before you begin the lab, you must complete the following steps:

1. On the host computer, start  **Microsoft Hyper-V Manager**.

2. In  **Hyper-V Manager**, click  **20697-2C-LON-DC1**, and in the  **Actions** pane, click **Start**.

3. In the  **Actions** pane, click **Connect**. Wait until the virtual machine starts. 

4. Sign in using the following credentials:
 
- User name:  **Adatum\\Administrator**

- Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for  **20697-2C-LON-CL2**. Sign in as  **Adatum\\Adam** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

6. Start  **20697-2C-LON-CL4**, and sign in as  **Admin** with password **Pa55w.rd**. 

7. For Internet access start  **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**. You do not need to sign in to this VM.



## Exercise 1: Configuring Work Folders
  
### Scenario
  
 Users currently are using Offline Files to keep local copies of data synchronized with data on a file server. However, many users are using devices that are not domain members, and they are complaining that they cannot use Offline Files. The IT department is considering implementing Work Folders, but it must confirm that users with devices that are not domain members will be able to use it. In addition, you also must check if Work Folders will be configured automatically on devices that are joined to the domain. You have been asked to implement a proof-of-concept deployment of Work Folders. You will use an internal Certificate Authority (CA) for the proof of concept and install the CA root certificate into the trusted root certificate store of the computer that is not a domain member. Based on the results, the IT department will decide whether Work Folders will meet the company’s needs.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure infrastructure requirements

2. Configure Group Policy settings to configure Work Folders

3. Import the Adatum CA root certificate to LON-CL4

4. Deploy Work Folders

5. Perform Work Folders synchronization

6. Prepare for the next lab



#### Task 1: Configure infrastructure requirements
  
1. On  **LON-DC1**, use Windows PowerShell to install the  **FS-SyncShareService** feature by using the **Install-WindowsFeature** cmdlet.

2. Use **Server Manager** to create a new **Sync share**. Use the following data:

  - Local path:  **C:\\syncshare1**

  - Structure for user folders: **User alias**

  - Grant sync access to groups: **Managers**

  - Device policies: No policy is selected


3. Use Server Manager to verify that  **syncshare1** displays in the **WORK FOLDERS** section, and that user **Adam Hobbs** is listed in the **USERS** section.

4. On  **LON-DC1**, use IIS Manager to add an  **https** binding to the default website. Use **LON-DC1.adatum.com** as the SSL certificate.



#### Task 2: Configure Group Policy settings to configure Work Folders
  
1. On  **LON-DC1**, use the  **Group Policy Management Console** to create and link a Group Policy named **Deploy Work Folders** to the **Managers** OU.

2. For the Deploy Work Folders Group Policy, in the Group Policy Management Editor, browse to:  
**User Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Work Folders**.

3. Enable the  **Specify Work Folders settings** setting, configure it with **https://lon-dc1.adatum.com** as **Work Folders URL**, and then select the  **Force automatic setup** check box.

4. On  **LON-CL2**, sign out, and then sign back in as  **adatum\\adam** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

5. Use  **File Explorer** to create a new text document in  **Work Folders** named **On LON-CL2**.



#### Task 3: Import the Adatum CA root certificate to LON-CL4
  
1. Sign in to  **LON-CL4** as **Admin**.

2. Map the  **J:** drive to **\\\\LON-DC1\\CertEnroll** as **Adatum\\Administrator**.

3. Create a new management console with the **Certificates** snap-in for the local computer.

4. Import the  **LON-DC1.Adatum.com_AdatumCA.crt** file from the **J:** drive to the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** store.

5. Close all open windows without saving.



#### Task 4: Deploy Work Folders
  
1. On  **LON-CL4**, use the  **Work FoldersControlPanel** item to set up Work Folders. Use the following settings:

  - Work Folders URL:  **https://lon-dc1.adatum.com**

  - Credentials:  **adatum\\adam** with the password **Pa55w.rd**

2. Verify that the file  **On LON-CL2.txt** is available in Work Folders on the LON-CL4 computer.



#### Task 5: Perform Work Folders synchronization
  
1. On  **LON-CL4**, in  **Work Folders**, create a new text document named  **On LON-CL4.txt**. 

2. Switch to  **LON-CL2**, and in **Work Folders**, verify that the  **On LON-CL4** file is displayed.

    >  **Note:** In Windows 10, Work Folders synchronizes immediately. In Windows 8.1, it could take up to 10 minutes for synchronization.

3. Disable the Ethernet network connection by using the  **Administrator** credentials and the password  **Pa55w.rd**.

4. In  **Work Folders**, modify the file  **On LON-CL2** by adding the content: **Modified offline**.

5. In  **Work Folders**, create a new text document named  **Offline LON-CL2**.

6. On  **LON-CL4**, in  **Work Folders**, modify the file  **On LON-CL2.txt** by adding the content **Online modification**.

7. On  **LON-CL2**, enable the Ethernet network connection. Use username  **Administrator** and the password **Pa55w.rd** as the credentials.

8. On  **LON-CL2**, verify that files now display in Work Folders, including **On LON-CL2** and **On LON-CL2-LON-CL2**.

    >  **Note:** Because the file was modified at two locations, a conflict occurred, and one of the copies was renamed by appending the name of the computer where the confilct occured.


#### Task 6: Prepare for the next lab
  
- When you have finished the lab, keep the virtual machines running as they will be needed for the next lab in this module.


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured Work Folders.



## 
  
**Question** 
Can a user access the same Work Folders from both domain devices and workgroup devices?

**Question** 
Can you access Work Folders content from a device that does not support Work Folders?
